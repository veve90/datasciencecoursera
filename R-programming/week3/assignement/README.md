# Assignment: Programming Assignment 2: Lexical Scoping

The second programming assignement require to write an R function is able to cache potentially time-consuming computations.
For example: computing the mean of a very long vector. If the contents of the vector are not changing, it may make sense to cache the value of the mean so that when we need it again, we can looked it up in the cache rather than recomputed
